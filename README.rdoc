= chef_solo_os

This repository is used to quickly build an Ubuntu Rails Linode VPS for RailsRumble via Chef Solo.
Includes:
  Mysql 5
  Apache2 +Passenger
  Nginx +Passenger

A deploy user is generated and assumes you will deploy your app to /var/www/sites/u/app/.
The deploy user has access to sudo via nopasswd.

Chef Solo allows you to run Chef Cookbooks in the absence of a Chef Server.
It does this by requiring that the complete cookbook be present on disk, which
it will fetch by getting a tarball from a remote URL.
